# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
### Analyze data from different campaigns, launch dates and funding goals, compare their outcomes to predict when could be the best dates to launch another theater kickstarter operation and have a higher probability of reaching the set goal. Louiseâ€™s report will reflect theatre campaigns that are only plays. 
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
A pivot table was used to create a line chart that shows the information of the theatre kickstarter data based on number of successful, failed and canceled projects.
The chart shows this data based on the month each project was launched.
 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
After reviewing the kickstarter data and visualizing it on a line chart we can find opportunities that will allow for successful theater campaigns. Based on the charts created for the data provided, it seems to be that a successful theater project would be better launched at the beginning of April through August. Pledges and participation towards reaching the set goal decline during these months, the lowest being in September. September through March participation is extremely low in comparison to the rest of the months and therefore, launching projects during this time seems imprudent because of low participation and low funding. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Based on the data, there are a number of other factors that could potentially affect the outcomes of successful, failed and canceled play projects and this data is solely based on goals and pledged amounts. Although this is something to keep in mind and possibly something we could potentially gather more data on during a different research opportunity, this kickstarter data provides some guidance for Louise to have an idea of when she should begin a new project and what a reasonable and attainable goal could be.
## Results
Some conclusions we can draw from this analysis are stated below.
Majority of successful theatre/plays projects should be launched during the months of April and May. Campaign projects that are unsuccessful tend to be launched in fall and winter. Further research could be done to discover what factors affect participation during these seasons in order to provide a deeper analyzed conclusion.  
Based on the kickstarter data, the most successful campaigns have a goal set between $1000 and $5000, with the second highest success percentage falling between $5000 to $25,000. Further research considering more factors that can affect success would have to be conducted in order to determine what makes these set goals attractive to contributors this making these campaigns more successful. 
There are some items to consider before drawing this conclusion. Do these goals have an effect on the number of backers? Is this data the same for other countries? Do the regions where these projects are launched have an impact on the number of backers? How are funds split in order to make one campaign more successful than the other if the goal amount is the same?  
With the kickstarter data provided we would be able to answer some of these questions if we create a table for different countries and compare the same data. We could also provide Louise with information about the average donation for the successful and failed projects and compare and contrast how they differ based on the goal amounts.
